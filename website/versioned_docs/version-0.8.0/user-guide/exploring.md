Whenever your start a flow, you need to explore data with a [source step](steps.md).

## How to explore data with Ananas Analytics? 

Drag and drop a source step and click on `explore` button. You should see a table with the actual data stored in the source. Note that it does not display all 
data since in some *big data* scenarios all data won't fit in your desktop memory. Hence you can navigate page by page.
