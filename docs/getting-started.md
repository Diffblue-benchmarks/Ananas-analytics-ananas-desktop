title: Building your first data flow
---

1. [Install](install.md) Ananas Analytics Desktop

2. [Create a project](projects.md) or [open an existing project](use-existing-project.md).

3. Draw your first [ETL](steps.md) flow by chaining steps on the analysis board. Basically choose a source to connect your data. Then drag and drop a transform step to filter, transform or aggregate your source data. Eventually add a destination to your flow in order to load the result into a datastore on your desktop, or add a visualization to visualize the result in chart.

4. [Run](running.md) the step of your choice. Click on the step and then click the `run` button.
 
5. When your job state is `DONE` it means the output data of the whole ETL flow are stored physically on your destination, or your data is ready for visualization.

Congratulations you're created your first data flow.
