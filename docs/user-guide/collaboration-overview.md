## Share your project with your team member

*Ananas Analytics Desktop* stores each of your project in a separate directory. See [**Where to find X?**](where-to-find) to find your project on your computer.

You can simply copy the directory and share it with your team members, who can import it in *Ananas Desktop* later.

As ananas project only consists of several plain text files. It is also possible to manage your project and project version with traditional Version Control Systems, for example, `git`, and share it with these version control systems. 

A typical usage is the engineers prepare the project with all the technical related settings filled, and share the project with non-technical user for business analysis.
