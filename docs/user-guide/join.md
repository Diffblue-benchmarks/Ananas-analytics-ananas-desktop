---

Combine two data sets that share at least one common field/column.

## Objective
Merging multiple data sets together is one of the most common but also frustrating data tasks. In Excel you may be used to using a series of `VLOOKUP` or `INDEX(MATCH())` functions. If you know SQL you can use a JOIN.

## Solution
In Ananas you don't need to know how to write Excel formulas or SQL queries. And once you've built a flow it's automatically repeatable whenever new data comes in. To combine your multiple data sets you can use a “join” step.
